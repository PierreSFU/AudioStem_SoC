2. REPORT DETAILS

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.504 ns between design_1_i/video_controller_0/inst/new_color_counter_reg[10]/C (clocked by clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0) and design_1_i/video_controller_0/inst/vga_r_reg[3]/D (clocked by clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.676 ns between design_1_i/video_controller_0/inst/animation_density_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0) and design_1_i/video_controller_0/inst/vga_b_reg[3]/D (clocked by clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.698 ns between design_1_i/video_controller_0/inst/animation_density_reg[1]_replica/C (clocked by clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0) and design_1_i/video_controller_0/inst/vga_g_reg[3]/D (clocked by clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 10.000 -name sys_clock -waveform {0.000 5.000} [get_ports sys_clock] (Source: C:/Users/pdrego/Downloads/Final_Project/6_VGA_Animation/top.xdc (Line: 1))
Previous: create_clock -period 10.000 [get_ports sys_clock] (Source: c:/Users/pdrego/Downloads/Final_Project/6_VGA_Animation/vivado/Lab4_1.gen/sources_1/bd/design_1/ip/design_1_clk_wiz_0_0/design_1_clk_wiz_0_0.xdc (Line: 56))
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-7#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten on the same source  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint defined on the same source. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 10.000 -name sys_clock -waveform {0.000 5.000} [get_ports sys_clock] (Source: C:/Users/pdrego/Downloads/Final_Project/6_VGA_Animation/top.xdc (Line: 1))
